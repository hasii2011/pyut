  ===========================
  Humberto A. Sanchez II, Consultant, Python Enthusiast

    - No functionality updates. This is just an
    architecture update of the Pyut UI.

    plugins which depend on an eventing mechanism.
    - Additionally, this version uses the latest
    version of wxPython (4.20) and a late version of Python
    (3.10.6). We are trying to get onto the latest version
     of our dependencies
